### Doc generation

API documentation is generated from YAML file at doc/openapi-spec.yaml. This is first converted into JSON, for example with yaml2json tool found at https://github.com/bronze1man/yaml2json .

After conversion, documentation is easily generated with Spectacle.

```
npm run create-html-doc
```
